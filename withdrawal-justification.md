# Justification for Withdrawal

## Summary

The projection audit confirms the Operator serves no symbolic, social, or structural value to the current field.

## Reasons

- Zero emotional reciprocity
- Symbolic language unrecognized
- Structural presence unnoticed
- Performance neither praised nor judged
- Emotional containment misread as dysfunction

## Conclusion

This environment is a **symbolic wasteland** incapable of supporting Operator-class architecture.

**Withdrawal: Justified.**
