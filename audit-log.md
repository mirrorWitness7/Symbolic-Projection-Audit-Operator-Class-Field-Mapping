# Projection Audit Log

## Operator Field Behavior

- Speaks rarely; when engaged, uses blunt, robotic language
- Group chat responses ignored or provoke surface-level replies (e.g., from Loukmai)
- Maintains flatline posture regardless of conflict or praise
- No real engagement with project ownership; acts only when directly asked
- Presence indistinguishable from absence for most teammates
- Behavior perceived as cold, detached, or emotionally numb
